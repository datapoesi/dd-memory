**dd-memory**

A small thing I created mainly because I wanted to become better at [CSS Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_grid_layout), and a [memory game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)) was one of the ideas I had for accomplishing this. Overall pretty straight-forward to create, although one definite struggle was getting the responsive design right.
